# NFT Universe

An NFT database that includes entities for different blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Algorand, and so on, NFT projects on these blockchains, NFT segments such as art, collectible, game, metaverse, and utility.

We will be comparing different projects and determining which ones tend to do better over time, while also studying the market trends.

This project would serve as a one-stop shop for a range of users regardless of their experience in the NFT space and provide more value in less time.

## Team Size

We are a group of three, namely :-

1.) Shreyansh Goushal
2.) Sri Tejaswi Vadapalli
3.) Shiva Kranthi Maddhuri

### Team Size Justification According To The Scope Of The Project

We will collect data from multiple NFT marketplaces belonging to different blockchains, clean those massive datasets, design efficient ER-Diagrams, and build a well-planned database management system. Therefore, we think the team size is justified for this task to be completed in the given time frame.
